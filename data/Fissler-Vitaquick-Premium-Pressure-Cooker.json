[{"reviews":"I loved this pressure cooker from the moment I unpacked it.  This is what high quality looks and feels and performs like.  My first meal in it was Hungarian Goulash, the next one Chicken Chili with beans. For those new to pressure cooking, every pressure cooker will at first release quite a bit of steam.  This is necessary to allow for pressure buildup and displace unneeded air.  Once that is accomplished the valves will close and the pressure will now rise. My cooker does not show green and red on the pressure valve, just white rings.  I might ask the company about that unless they monitor ratings and contact me, but that is not a dealbreaker for me since I have used pressure cookers for many years. I have several sizes in electric pressure cookers, but with winter on the way I rather have one that will efficiently work on my gas stove when the power goes out.  And I absolutely refuse to use aluminum for cooking.  Only stainless steel and cast iron will do for me.","sentiment_type":"negative"},{"reviews":"We LOVE this pressure cooker, it replaces our old Fager pressure cooker which we just could not find rings for any  more.  We are over that now because this cooker is just so aesthetically pleasing, works quite well and is easy to clean.  Wirecutter of NYTimes recommended this one, glad I listened to them!","sentiment_type":"positive"},{"reviews":"This is a sturdy, well built stovetop pressure cooker. I bought it to replace my old Fagor, and it has done wonderfully. It’s heavily constructed, so you can easily brown your meat in the cooker without burning. It’s large enough to accommodate a whole chicken or a 4-6  pound roast without a problem. My only issue is that the pressure reading button seems a bit lax. There are two spring-loaded blue rings, one for low pressure and one for high, and you have to eyeball it carefully to figure out the pressure of the cooker. I would have preferred a more precise means of ascertaining proper pressure.","sentiment_type":"positive"},{"reviews":"This pressure cooker is very well made! It is hefty and can cook your meat up to tenderness in no time. It does take a bit of learning and reading the manual (and maybe watching some instruction videos) to get the hang of it up it is so worth the effort.","sentiment_type":"positive"},{"reviews":"This pressure cooker quickly tenderizes tough cuts, infuses deep flavors, retains moisture, promotes healthier cooking, and delivers juicy, flavorful meats. It does all of this while looking good and being pretty affordable compared to other pressure cookers on the market. We've found this to be an instrumental tool in our kitchen! All in the quality of this pressure cooker really stands out!","sentiment_type":"positive"},{"reviews":"I ordered this pressure cooker in October 16, in 2024 and Receive October 19 The shocking thing is this thick book is 90% in Chinese writing there is NO looking time instruction  For example for red meat or chicken or vegetable!","sentiment_type":"negative"},{"reviews":"The premium 6.3 qt pressure cooker is good for all cooking surfaces. This is great because I converted to an induction cook top last year, and finding cookware that works for it isn't always that easy. I mean there is cookware out there, but not always just what you want or need in the styles, size or price point you're looking for. I think this one is. This one is really nice, and high quality. It's is nice and deep. The latching mechanism is solid, and the safety features seem good (I hope I never have to use the safety features). I'm glad I found this pressure cooker though. I've been missing some of my old recipes that I used to do with my old one that I could no longer use on the induction cook top. I'm still saving it for the kids one day. But now, this is my new one.  I like it. But I confess that I miss the little Che-Che-Che of the regulator.","sentiment_type":"positive"},{"reviews":"The media could not be loaded. This arrived defective, and when I called Amazon regarding it, they told me that someone from he company would contact me within 48 hours. It's now been that, and I've not heard anything about getting my replacement, so I'm posting this review. All I wanted was to have the lid replaced. Until that's done and the item works as it should, I stand by my review.","sentiment_type":"negative"}]
