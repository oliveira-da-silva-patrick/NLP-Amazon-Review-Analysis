[{"reviews": "I was on the fence about upgrading from i5 12400f, which is a beast of a cpu. Some pros and cons.  My specs: RTX 4070ti,  z790 ddr5 gigabyte mobo, 32 gb fury ram, 1tb WD black SSD gen 4. Pros: More cores Noticeably faster in some areas like booting and some applications. Some triple A GPU bound games will get a noticeable FPS boost. (Not huge, talking 3-10 at most). CPU bound games (emulators for me) will get much better stability and cpu usage reduction. Cons: If you are looking for energy efficiency these 13th gen and higher chips are NOT it. More cores means more energy draw for sure. On Triple A games the chip is using 20-30 watts more electricity. In emulators like RPCS3 it\u2019s nearly double. I went from 30- 40 watt average to average 80 and in some instances spiked above 100. The good thing is emulators are much less GPU bound so the wattage balances out, sort of. Heat- I\u2019m running an AIO lian li 360 Galahad, with the 12400f I was nearly always running at room temp (my house gets lots of shade and stays cool/cold) so I was used to 22c range. With the 13600k you  will see a 10 degree increase even at idle. Emulators will get into the 60s while triple A games 40s and 50s. With the 12400f my fan curve rarely ever triggered high fan speeds. With the 13th gen you will definitely hear those fans work at load. Side notes I tried the 13600k on two mobos (z790 and 690) you can use it on older 690 compatible mobos, you just need to flash bios to latest. It was super easy on the gigabyte z790 and 690 mobo. Overall. The performance jump is noticeable in some games. But far more noticeable is the increase in heat and wattage usage. If you have a 12th gen and are on the fence you really don\u2019t need to upgrade, however depending on what you are doing with it could be the main factor. I wanted my RPCS3 to run at 60fps in 4k constantly and the 13600k did the trick.  (playing MGS4 guns of the patriots in 4k and stable is unreal!)", "sentiment_type": "positive"}, {"reviews": "It's fast and runs cool overclocked.

SUPER FAST FOR GAMING", "sentiment_type": "positive"}, {"reviews": "Excellent price to performance, upgraded my 12400f, not whole lot of benefit to 14th gen cpus. Competes enough for the big boys if you have the other components already.", "sentiment_type": "positive"}, {"reviews": "I bought 2 of these to put in mine and my wifes builds, both work perfect and dominate every game on the market, including Tarkov which if you play you know the struggle with CPU on that game. My wifes runs bone stock with a NZXT Kraken 280mm and stays idle at about 29c and around 55c when gaming. Mine on the other hand is on a Vetro 360 aio and is overclocked to 5.6ghz all core stable and can get quite warm. Reaching 80-88c at times. Running mine at stock speed drops it to about 55c during gaming as well. I got mine to a 5.7ghz stable but started hitting TJmax so i undervolted and clocked down to 5.6ghz and runs fine. I have a friend who went with the 13900k and hes only netting 10-12 more fps than my OCed 13600k. Compared to the rest of the 13/14 gen CPUs the price to performance of the 13600k is unbeatable at the moment.", "sentiment_type": "positive"}, {"reviews": "This CPU is powerful enough to run my pc super fast. I have a simple air cooler, and the temps do get a bit hot, so I wish that was better. It did get too hot one time when playing Black Ops 6 and shut down my computer on me, but I restarted it and gave it more ventilation. My room was fairly warm, which could have contributed to this. I bought an AIO cooler to combat this problem. Other than that, the CPU has been very stable, and I\u2019ve been able to play demanding games with no problem. For reference I also have a 4070 super, ASUS B760 motherboard, and 32GB of DDR5 Ram. For a decent pc on a budget, this CPU is the way to go especially for the price point, but it\u2019s definitely not perfect or the most powerful in its generation so keep that in mind.", "sentiment_type": "positive"}, {"reviews": "Been using this cpu for about a year now and it's amazing. For every game I play, some of which are known to be cpu intnesive, it has only gotten up to about 30% usage. Sure it is not a cheap cpu, but it definetly has the processing power despite being an i5. Even when I have stress tested it to 100% usage, it still easily stays cool with a vetroo v5 cooler. Plus you can brag to people that your cpu has 14 cores and 20 logical processors. great cpu, would recommend", "sentiment_type": "positive"}, {"reviews": "Actualizaci\u00f3n 1 (21-11-2024): El producto aparenta estar en buen estado, a\u00fan no me llega la motherboard compatible por lo que mas adelante verificar\u00e9 su funcionalidad", "sentiment_type": "neutral"}, {"reviews": "S\u00edmplismente o melhor processador da gera\u00e7\u00e3o I5", "sentiment_type": "neutral"}, {"reviews": "Upgrading to the Intel Core i5-13600KF Desktop Processor from my Ryzen 5800X3D has been a game-changer for my computing experience. This powerhouse of a processor, with its 14 cores (6 P-cores and 8 E-cores) and a substantial 24M cache, has significantly enhanced the performance of my system. The ability of this CPU to turbo up to 5.1 GHz is particularly impressive, contributing to a remarkable improvement in processing speed and overall system responsiveness. Whether I'm running demanding applications, engaging in high-end gaming, or juggling multiple tasks simultaneously, the i5-13600KF handles it all with an ease that is immediately noticeable. The efficiency and speed are especially evident in CPU-intensive tasks, where this processor clearly outshines its predecessor. Beyond just raw performance, what I appreciate about the Intel Core i5-13600KF is its balance between power and efficiency. The division of Performance-cores and Efficiency-cores means that it smartly allocates resources based on the task at hand, ensuring optimal performance without unnecessary power consumption. This aspect is crucial for a balanced system that's powerful yet not overly taxing on energy use. The upgrade process itself was straightforward, and the compatibility with a wide range of motherboards and hardware made the transition smooth. In terms of gaming, the difference is palpable, with smoother frame rates and faster loading times. For creative tasks like video editing and 3D rendering, the performance boost has been equally beneficial, noticeably reducing the time spent on rendering and processing. All in all, the Intel Core i5-13600KF has proven to be an excellent upgrade from the Ryzen 5800X3D, offering a superb blend of performance, efficiency, and versatility. It's a 5-star processor that I'd highly recommend to anyone looking to upgrade their system for an enhanced computing experience.", "sentiment_type": "positive"}, {"reviews": "Tippitoppi", "sentiment_type": "neutral"}, {"reviews": "A caixa estava danificada, mas o processador vinha bem acondicionado no interior.
